# trollmoji [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/trollmoji.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/trollmoji) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jHoldroyd/trollmoji.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jHoldroyd/trollmoji)

ðŸ‘» Slack bot for having some fun with your team

## Prerequisites
Before getting started you will need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6 or greater. You will also need to get a Slack API token from [here](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens). If you'd like to recieve push notifications detailing your teams despair then you'll need an account with [Pushover](https://pushover.net).

> **Why a legacy token?** Because it allows you to interact with the Slack Real-time API without adding a bot user!

## Installation

```sh
$ npm i -g trollmoji
```

> **Note:** On first run a .env file, data directory and config files will be created, as well as downloading the required emoji data and then closing. Please add your Slack/Pushover keys to the .env file before running again.

## Usage

```sh
$ trollmoji
```

After running the command the tool will run setup, download the available emojis, and team users before moving on to waiting for incoming events from Slack.

```sh
$ info: Setup complete, starting
$ info: Loaded 955 emojis
$ info: Found 30 users
$ info: Ready & waiting for event triggers
```

> **Note:** trollmoji is a fire and forget tool with few configuration options, however you can use `-v` or `--verbose` to get a more detailed output from the CLI tool
